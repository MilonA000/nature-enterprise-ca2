Enterprise CA2 Report  

1. Dataset Overview 

For this CA, we decided on a public dataset of car listings. Our source for this dataset was kaggle.com (1 CSV file, 17.2 MB) with it collecting data on price, year, mileage, city, state, vehicle identification number, make and model of the cars. The dataset we analysed had 851,123 unique rows of data, making the dataset very large in size however giving us a lot of data to work with as a whole. 
 
 

2. Data Cleaning 
 
To ensure that the data was cleaned thoroughly, we removed all duplicates that was in the dataset, we did this to ensure that the metrics weren't inflated and to remove redundant data. After removing the duplicates, we proceeded to remove data with missing values (e.g. mileage or model was missing in some rows) as it may lead to inconsistent data and distort our analysis of the data itself. Finally, to finish our cleaning of the dataset, we conducted a check for any structural errors or mistakes in the format of the data, examples of this include checking for grammatical errors and making sure data is consistently in the same format.  
   (May have to add more about how we cleaned the data, such as the code and all) 
 
3. Descriptive Statistics 
 
In order to make the dataset more cohesive and help with summarizing the data, we decided on gathering the mean, median, mode, range, variance and standard deviation for each column contained within the dataset that we finished cleaning.  
 
 
 
 

4. Visual Analysis 

Visual Analysis is used to understand the distribution of prices and mileage within the dataset. 

 

The Histogram shows that vehicles are priced mostly between $11,500 to 16,500. There are fewer vehicles at higher prices, creating a slight right skew in the distribution. This shows that majority of cars fall within a mid-price range, while only small number are significantly more expensive. 

 

This mileage histogram shows that most vehicles have between 20,000 and 60,000 miles. Only a small number of vehicles has very low or very high mileage. This difference in mileage helps show us the difference in car prices as higher mileage generally lowers a car value. 

 

 

5. Machine Learning 

We used machine learning  to try and predict the car prices based on the data. We used linear regression which is a learning algorithm, it basically means that the model would learn from the data where the correct answers are known In our project we already had the actual car prices so the model had learned patterns between the features and the price.  

What We Used in the Model 

In the model we used the data from Mileage and the year the car was made because because from our visual analysis it was clear that the higher the mileage the lower the price of the car would generally be and the newer the car it would usually be a higher price so it made sense for those to be our main predictors.  

How we made the code was that we first loaded the dataset using pandas then we seperated the data into X which were the input features (mileage and year the car was  made) and Y which were the output features (price) which tells the model to use mileage and year to try and predict the price and after that we split the data set into training and testing data so we used 80 percent to train the model and the other 20 percent to test it out. It was important to do because it makes sure that the model isnt just memorising the data it checks to see if it can predict prices on data it hasnt seen before. We then created the linear regression model and trained it using the training data so when it trains it basically calculates the relationship between mileage and the year and the price and once that was done we used it to predict prices on the test data. And then we calculated the mean absolute error which tells us on average how far off our predictions were from the real prices. 

 

6. Limitations & Ethics 

While picking this dataset, we noticed an ethical concern on it collecting data on vehicle identification numbers. While the VIN is publicly visible on each car, it can pose a serious privacy risk when combined with other data, such as the data within the dataset. The vehicle identification number being public along with the other data from the dataset could lead to it being traced back to an owner, this would lead to the VIN being considered personal data if it can be traced back and may result in situations such as scammers attempting to contact the owners of the vehicle. 
 
Along with the ethical concern with the VIN, we also noticed a large limitation with the dataset, this was that due to the data being found online and being so large, parts of the data might be inaccurate to the real world or may have even been entered incorrectly despite being in the correct format. (Ill add the rest of this tomorrow after asking for the link to the original dataset, not the file)  
 

 

 

 

7. Conclusion 

In conclusion, this project analysed a large dataset of car listings to have a better understanding of the factors that influence vehicles prices. Through various methods like visual analysis, data cleaning and the use of descriptive statistics, clear patterns were identified in the dataset. 

The analysis showed us that most vehicles fall within a medium price range and have moderate mileage levels. Visual analysis confirmed that higher mileage generally results in lower vehicles prices, while vehicles with lower mileage would have a higher price.  

By using machine learning we were able to move from basic analysis to actually predicting. The linear regression model allowed us to give a smart guess on the vehicle prices based on the mileage and the year the car was made and we measured how good it was by using mean absolute error this shows how machine tools can be used to generate real data related predictions and could support making calculated decisions in a market. 

This project highlights the importance of proper data cleaning, descriptive and visual analysis, and ethical consideration when working with large real-world datasets. Overall, it demonstrates how enterprise computing tools can be helpful to extract useful information and support informed decision making within the automotive market.
